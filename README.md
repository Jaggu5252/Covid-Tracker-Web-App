# Covid-Tracker-Web-App
I have created a Covid19 Tracker web app which will show you all the data related to covid like total no of cases till now,daily cases,daily deaths, Total recovered cases for over 190 countries with regular updates. 


I made it by using Django web Framework, API, Python, HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I used classes of Bootstrap and css to design the web page
